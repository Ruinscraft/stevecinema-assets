# Menuboard

Assets used for the menuboard graphic in the theater.

## Editing menu items

1. Open the HTML document in your text editor of choice
2. Scroll down until you find the &lt;section class="col"&gt; you want to edit
3. Replace the values in the &lt;td&gt; tags with appropriate values

Note that the length of text in the table cells may drastically alter the resulting dimensions of the menuboard. If this is the case, either edit the text to be shorter, or alter the CSS to shrink down the menu to a 5:1 ratio. Use your best judgement.

## How to render to PNG

1. Open the HTML document in web browser of choice
2. Press the print-screen key on your keyboard, or use a screenshot program
3. In a graphics editor, paste in the screenshot
4. Crop area to within the border
5. This graphic is design for a 5:1 display, so ensure the resulting image has a 5:1 ratio

Note that this was designed using a 1920x1080 monitor, so a 5:1 image would be 1920x384.

See the PNG render in this directory for an example.
